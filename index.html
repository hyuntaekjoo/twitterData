                        My name is Hyuntaek and I am a customer advisory at SAS. I am really happy to tell you about my personal project. :)  
                        <br> First of all, I really would like to improve this project, so please let me know your any comments and thoughts. 
                        <br> This project is not focused on the UI and UX so it may looks ugly.
                        <br> However, there is no problem to use.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr size=5 noshade>
        <p>
            If you find some public data for your data analysis, you may find some data from twitter.
            But I found the process using twitter API is little bit difficult to us. 
            <br>You should know not only the knowledge of the API, but also programming skills. But I know, many of you guys don't have experience of programming.
            <br>That's why this project began. I just want to make it easier and less stress to get public data from twitter.
            <br>As you know, twitter has a lot of good stuff for data analysis. Not a few media analyze the tweets of US presidential candidates!
            <br>You can catch the treanding topics, events, lifestyles, ecomonics, politics and etc from twitter.  
            <br> Now, all you need to is your twitter account and developer key from the twitter.
